# What is Memory Optimised Instances

Memory Optimised Instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads tha process large data set in memory.

Whenever you are working on large database and for that it needs huge RAM for data processing so we need to take Memory Optimised Instances.

## Instances available in 3 types
1. R-series
2. X-series
3. Z-series
