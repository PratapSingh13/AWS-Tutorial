## c4 Instances
c4 instances are optimized for compute intensive workloads and deliver very cost effective high performance at low price per compute ratio.

**It has following configuration:**

**vCPU -** min 2 to max 36

**RAM -** min 3.75GB to max 60GB

**Instance Storage -** EBS only

**Network Bandwith -** max 10Gbps

**Instances are well suited for following for:**
- WebServers
